# TODO

[ ] Need a nicer interface to choose between games.
[ ] For games like `Codenames` consider toggling between `teams` instead of toggling between `players` and set "player activity" based on that. (Be mindful of `roles` though.)
[ ] Need a clean way for people to choose their team.
[ ] Need a way to restart a `Codenames` game.
[ ] Codes cannot be given that include the name of a card.
[ ] Make sure code is clean (relatively) on backend/frontend and fleshed out before moving onto a new game implementation.
[ ] Prevent abuse of game resets.
